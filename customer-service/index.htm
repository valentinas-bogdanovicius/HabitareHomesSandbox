                  We are committed to high standards of customer service.
                  However, there may be occasions when we do not meet the high
                  standards we set for ourselves. We welcome feedback and we
                  also take any form of complaint seriously. Working with our
                  local housing managers we will try wherever possible to
                  resolve the complaint to your satisfaction. Our aim is for
                  your complaint to be resolved as quickly as possible.

                          In 2024, we handled 44 complaints (31 Stage 1 and 13
                          Stage 2), compared to 15 in the previous year. The
                          majority (86%) related to new-build property defects.

                          improve our service for our customers we’ve made real
                          changes to how we deliver services. We’ve brought in
                          more people to help resolve issues, improved how we
                          communicate, and tightened up our agreements with

                <h3>Our 2 Stage Complaints Process</h3>
                <h4>Stage 1 Complaint</h4>
                <p>
                  You can raise a formal complaint, if you are dissatisfied with
                  a service we have provided or we have been unable to resolve
                  an issue to your satisfaction under our informal – quick
                  resolution process. This stage is normally where several
                  issues have occurred, and a more in-depth review of the issues
                  is required. Please send your request to our managing agent,
                  <a href="#agents" class="link">see details.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  You will receive an acknowledgment of the Stage 1 complaint
                  within 5 working days. Your complaint will be fully
                  investigated and responded to within 10 working days from the
                  date of receipt of your Stage 1 complaint. In some cases, it
                  may take longer to provide a full response if so, our managing
                  agent will agree a timeframe with you.
                </p>
                <h4 id="stage2">Stage 2 Complaint</h4>
                <p>
                  If you remain unhappy with the Stage 1 response, you can
                  request for your complaint to be escalated to Stage 2. Please
                  send your request to our managing agent,
                  <a href="#agents" class="link">see details.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our managing agent will then review your request in line with
                  the complaint policy and will notify you if the request has
                  been approved or refused.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once the request has been approved by the managing agent, your
                  complaint will be investigated by an independent member of
                  staff and a response will be sent to you within 20 working
                  days. In some cases, it may take longer to provide a full
                  response if so, our managing agent will agree a timeframe with
                  you.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If your Stage 2 review request has been refused, our managing
                  agent will write to you confirming the reasons why your
                  complaint hasn’t been escalated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  All Stage 2 escalation requests will be reviewed by the Asset
                  Manager of Habitare Homes to ensure that our residents are
                  receiving an effective and swift resolution.
                </p>
                <h3>External Review</h3>
                <h4>Housing Ombudsman</h4>
                <p>
                  At any stage during your complaint, you can approach the
                  Housing Ombudsman for independent advice regarding your
                  complaint. In addition, if you remain unhappy once our

                <p>
                  This can be an MP, local councillor, or customer panel, if
                  available with our managing agent. Our managing agent will
                  treat all enquiries received from a designated person the same
                  way as a Stage 1 complaint request and responded to within
                  <strong>10 working days</strong>.
                </p>
                <h3>Monitoring</h3>
                <p>
                  We will meet with our managing agents regularly to discuss
                  complaints and other negative feedback. The purpose of these
                  meetings is to ensure that the standard of customer service
                  remains high. On a monthly basis our managing agents will send
                  us a report on all complaints received. Additionally, our
                  managing agent will notify us as soon as possible where a
                  Stage 2 complaint or Ombudsman referral has been received.
