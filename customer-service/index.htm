   <h3>Introduction</h3>
   <p>We are committed to high standards of customer service. However, there may be occasions when we do not meet the high standards we set for ourselves. We welcome feedback and we also take any form of complaint seriously. Working with our local housing managers we will try wherever possible to resolve the complaint to your satisfaction. Our aim is for your complaint to be resolved as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p>In 2024, we handled 44 complaints (31 Stage 1 and 13 Stage 2), compared to 15 in the previous year. The majority (86%) related to new-build property defects.</p>
            <p>The remaining issues were split between repairs (7%), estate charges (2%), and other matters (5%).</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>Every complaint we’ve received represents an area where we accept that things should be better. To improve our service for our customers we’ve made real changes to how we deliver services. We’ve brought in more people to help resolve issues, improved how we communicate, and tightened up our agreements with developers.</p>
          </div>
          <div>
            <p>We understand that what matters isn’t just what we say, but what we actually do. While we’re making progress with our new approaches to handling defects and complaints, we know there’s still more work to do. Your feedback has been invaluable in showing us where we need to focus our efforts.</p>

   <h3>Complaints Process</h3> 
   <p>We define a complaint as an expression of dissatisfaction, however made, about the standard of service, actions, or lack of action by the landlord, its own staff, or those acting on its behalf, affecting a resident or group of residents. All complaints are recorded and managed in accordance with the two stage process summarised below. </p>
<p id="agents">If you are dissatisfied with any services provided by Habitare or any of our partners we would like to hear your feedback and resolve the matter quickly to restore your trust in us and to help us improve our work. The quickest route to resolution is to contact your local managing agent directly and their contact details can be found below.

<h3>Our 2 Stage Complaints Process</h3>
<h4>Stage 1 Complaint</h4>
<p>You can raise a formal complaint, if you are dissatisfied with a service we have provided or we have been unable to resolve an issue to your satisfaction under our informal – quick resolution process. This stage is normally where several issues have occurred, and a more in-depth review of the issues is required. Please send your request to our managing agent, <a href="#agents" class="link">see details.</a></p>
<p>You will receive an acknowledgment of the Stage 1 complaint within 5 working days. Your complaint will be fully investigated and responded to within 10 working days from the date of receipt of your Stage 1 complaint. In some cases, it may take longer to provide a full response if so, our managing agent will agree a timeframe with you.</p>
<h4 id="stage2">Stage 2 Complaint </h4>
<p>If you remain unhappy with the Stage 1 response, you can request for your complaint to be escalated to Stage 2. Please send your request to our managing agent, <a href="#agents" class="link">see details</a>.</p>
<p>You will receive an acknowledgment of the Stage 2 complaint within 5 working days. Your complaint will be fully investigated and responded to within 20 working days from the date of receipt of your Stage 2 complaint. In some cases, it may take longer to provide a full response if so, our managing agent will agree a timeframe with you.</p>
<p>This is the final stage of our internal complaints process. When responding to your complaint at stage 2 we will provide details of the Housing Ombudsman should you remain unhappy with our response.</p>
<p>We are a member of the Housing Ombudsman scheme and we follow the code of practice. The Housing Ombudsman offers a service to help resolve disputes between landlords and tenants. The service is free, independent, and impartial. You can contact them at any stage of your complaint for advice. The Housing Ombudsman will expect you to have completed our complaints process before they will investigate your complaint. The contact details for the Housing Ombudsman are below:</p>
