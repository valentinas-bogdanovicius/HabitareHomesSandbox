                unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access
                to your personal data to those employees, agents, contractors and
                other third parties who have a business need to know. They will only
                process your personal data on our instructions and they are subject to

                9.1 We will only retain your personal data for as long as reasonably
                necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for, including for the
                purposes of satisfying any legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or
                reporting requirements. We may retain your personal data for a longer
                period in the event of a complaint or if we reasonably believe there is
                a prospect of litigation in respect to our relationship with you.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            
                9.2 To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we
                consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the
                potential risk of harm from unauthorised use or disclosure of your
                personal data, the purposes for which we process your personal data and
                whether we can achieve those purposes through other means, and the
                applicable legal, regulatory, tax, accounting or other requirements.

        <p>

                it can no longer be associated with you) for research or statistical
                purposes, in which case we may use this information indefinitely

                You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to

                your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
                exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to
                ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no
                right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further
                information in relation to your request to speed up our response.

                We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
                Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is
                particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
                case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

            11.1 <strong>LAWFUL BASIS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Legitimate Interest</strong>
            means the interest of our business in conducting and managing our business
            to enable us to give you the best service/product and the best and most
            secure experience. We make sure we consider and balance any potential
            impact on you (both positive and negative) and your rights before we
            process your personal data for our legitimate interests. We do not use your
            personal data for activities where our interests are overridden by the
            impact on you (unless we have your consent or are otherwise required or
            permitted to by law). You can obtain further information about how we
            assess our legitimate interests against any potential impact on you in
            respect of specific activities by contacting us.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Performance of Contract</strong>
            means processing your data where it is necessary for the performance of a
            contract to which you are a party or to take steps at your request before
            entering into such a contract.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Comply with a legal obligation</strong>
            means processing your personal data where it is necessary for compliance
            with a legal obligation that we are subject to.
        </p>
        <p>
            11.2 <strong>THIRD PARTIES</strong>

        <p>
            11.3 <strong>YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            
                You have the right to:
            
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Request access </strong>
            to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access
            request"). This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold
            about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Request correction </strong>
            of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any
            incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may
            need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Request erasure </strong>
            of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove
            personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process
            it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
            data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to
            processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
            unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply
            with local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply
            with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be
            notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Object to processing </strong>
            of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or
            those of a third party) and there is something about your particular
            situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as
            you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have
            the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct
            marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
            compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override
            your rights and freedoms.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Request restriction of processing </strong>
            of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
            processing of your personal data in the following scenarios:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    If you want us to establish the data's accuracy.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to
                    erase it.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it
                    as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify
                    whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>Request the transfer </strong>
            of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you,
            or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured,
            commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies
            to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use
            or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Withdraw consent at any time </strong>
            where we are relying on consent to process your personal data. However,
            this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out before
            you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent, we may not be
            able to provide certain products or services to you. We will advise you if
            this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
