        </p>
        <p>
            
            3.6 <strong>Children's personal data</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            3.6.1 Our website is not intended for children and we do not knowingly
            collect data relating to children on our website.

            including their name, date of birth, gender and medical details (allergies,
            health conditions, disabilities, or vulnerabilities). This is required for
            checking the property is not overcrowded and to assess other tenancy
            management issues where all householders, their ages and any relevant
            medical details are required to be known.
        </p>
        <p>
            3.6.4 We may receive children’s information if we are involved in the
            housing and tenancy aspects of a welfare case as part of a multi-agency
            working solution.

        <p>

            contract we have with you, and you fail to provide that data when
            requested, we may not be able to perform the contract we have or are trying
            to enter into with you (for example, to provide you with goods or

            have with us but we will notify you if this is the case at the time.

                10.1 Under certain circumstances, you have rights under data protection
                laws in relation to your personal data
            
            . You have the right to:
        </p>
        <p>
            10.1.1 request access to your personal data (see paragraph 11.3.1);
        </p>
        <p>
            10.1.2 request correction of your personal data (see paragraph 11.3.2);
        </p>
        <p>
            10.1.3 request erasure of your personal data (see paragraph 11.3.3);
        </p>
        <p>
            10.1.4 object to processing of your personal data (see paragraph 11.3.4);
        </p>
        <p>
            10.1.5 request restriction of processing your personal data (see paragraph
            11.3.5);
        </p>
        <p>

                10.2 If you wish to exercise any of the rights set out above, please

        </p>

            10.3 <strong>No fee usually required</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            
                You will not have to pay a fee to access your personal data (or to
                exercise any of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable
                fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or excessive.
                Alternatively, we could refuse to comply with your request in these
                circumstances.

            10.4 <strong>What we may need from you</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            
                We may need to request specific information from you to help us confirm
                your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to
                exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to
                ensure that personal data is not disclosed to any person who has no
                right to receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further
                information in relation to your request to speed up our response.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            10.5 <strong>Time limit to respond</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            
                We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
                Occasionally it could take us longer than a month if your request is
                particularly complex or you have made a number of requests. In this
                case, we will notify you and keep you updated.

                11.1.1 Legitimate Interest means the interest of our business in
                conducting and managing our business to enable us to give you the best
                service/product and the best and most secure experience. We make sure
                we consider and balance any potential impact on you (both positive and
                negative) and your rights before we process your personal data for our
                legitimate interests. We do not use your personal data for activities
                where our interests are overridden by the impact on you (unless we have
                your consent or are otherwise required or permitted to by law). You can
                obtain further information about how we assess our legitimate interests
                against any potential impact on you in respect of specific activities

                to take steps at your request before entering into such a contract.

            11.3 <strong>Your Legal Rights</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            You have the right to:
        </p>
        <p>
            11.3.1 <strong>Request access </strong>
            to your personal data (commonly known as a "data subject access request").
            This enables you to receive a copy of the personal data we hold about you
            and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            11.3.2 <strong>Request correction </strong>
            of the personal data that we hold about you. This enables you to have any
            incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you corrected, though we may
            need to verify the accuracy of the new data you provide to us.
        </p>
        <p>
            
            11.3.3 <strong>Request erasure </strong>
            of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to delete or remove
            personal data where there is no good reason for us continuing to process
            it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your personal
            data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to
            processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
            unlawfully or where we are required to erase your personal data to comply
            with the law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply with
            your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be notified
            to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
        </p>
        <p>
            11.3.4 <strong>Object to processing </strong>
            of your personal data where we are relying on a legitimate interest (or
            those of a third party) and there is something about your particular
            situation which makes you want to object to processing on this ground as
            you feel it impacts on your fundamental rights and freedoms. You also have
            the right to object where we are processing your personal data for direct
            marketing purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have
            compelling legitimate grounds to process your information which override
            this right to object.
        </p>
        <p>
            
            
                11.3.5 <strong>Request restriction of processing </strong>
            
            of your personal data. This enables you to ask us to suspend the processing
            of your personal data in the following scenarios:
        </p>
        <p>
            (a) if you want us to establish the data's accuracy;
        </p>
        <p>
            (b) where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase
            it;
        </p>
        <p>
            (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer require it as
            you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal claims; and
        </p>
        <p>
            (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need to verify whether
            we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
        </p>
        <p>
            
            11.3.6 <strong>Request the transfer </strong>
            of your personal data to you or to a third party. We will provide to you,
            or a third party you have chosen, your personal data in a structured,
            commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this right only applies
            to automated information which you initially provided consent for us to use
            or where we used the information to perform a contract with you.
        </p>
        <p>
            11.3.7 <strong>Withdraw consent at any time </strong>
            where we are relying on consent (as opposed to another lawful basis for
            processing (for example "legitimate interests") to process your personal
            data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any processing
            carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you withdraw your consent,
            we may not be able to provide certain products or services to you. We will
            advise you if this is the case at the time you withdraw your consent.
